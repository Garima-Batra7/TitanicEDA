# Titanic Survival Prediction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview

This project involves **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset using Python.  
The goal is to uncover insights about survival patterns based on variables such as **Age**, **Sex**, **Passenger Class**, **Fare**, **Embarked Port**, and **Family Size**.

##  Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`).
   - Checked data types and summary statistics.

2. **Univariate Analysis:**
   - Plotted histograms and boxplots for numerical variables (`Age`, `Fare`).
   - Countplots for categorical variables (`Sex`, `Pclass`, `Embarked`).

3. **Bivariate Analysis:**
   - Analyzed survival rates based on `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Family Size`, and `Embarked`.
   - Created barplots and scatterplots to explore relationships.

4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Generated a heatmap to study feature correlations.

5. **Key Insights:**

   - **Gender Impact:** Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
   - **Class Impact:** Passengers in 1st Class had a significantly higher survival chance.
   - **Age Factor:** Younger passengers tended to survive more.
   - **Fare Influence:** Higher fare passengers had better survival odds.
   - **Embarked Port:** Passengers embarking from Cherbourg (`C`) had higher survival rates.
   - **Family Influence:** Passengers traveling with 1-2 family members had a better survival rate compared to those traveling alone or in large groups.
